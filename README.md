# Building-SpringBoot-MicroServices
This repository deals with the highlighting of the importance of Microservices in real world scenarios by building them from scratch to building Apache Kafka and RabbitMq  to handle real streaming data

## Introduction
### What are Microservices? 
Microservices allow large applications to be split into smaller pieces that operate independently. Each 'piece' has its responsibilities and can carry them out regardless of what the other components are doing.  In other words it can also be defined as small, independent components that you can combine to build larger applications. These components can be rescaled, debugged and built independently which increases the rescalability and debugging , testing processes of traditional Monolithic applications will be light weighted.
